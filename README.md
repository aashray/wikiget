# wikiget
A **A quick and dirty** tool (written in python) to get a short hand summary of a topic from wikipedia.

Usage: *wikiget <name/place/thing>*

Not at all bug free. Certainly could be made much better and robust. More error handling.
Just something I did 5 minutes. Found it very useful. And I don't need more than this.

Uses only inbuilt libraries, no dependecy on any lib.

Examples:


`./wikiget.py "hello world"`
> A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to the user. Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program.[1] It is often the very first program people write when they are new to the language.

`./wikiget.py "foobar"`
> The terms foobar (/ˈfuːbɑːr/), or foo and others are used as placeholder names (also referred to as metasyntactic variables) in computer programming or computer-related documentation.[1] They have been used to name entities such as variables, functions, and commands whose exact identity is unimportant and serve only to demonstrate a concept.

`./wikiget.py "steve jobs"`
> Steven Paul "Steve" Jobs (/ˈdʒɒbz/; February 24, 1955&#160;– October 5, 2011) was an American information technology entrepreneur and inventor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer (CEO) of Apple Inc.; CEO and majority shareholderof Pixar Animation Studios;[3] a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT Inc. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Shortly after his death, Jobs's official biographer, Walter Isaacson, described him as a "creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing."[2]
